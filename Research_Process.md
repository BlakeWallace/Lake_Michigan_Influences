# Research Process

## Research Questions

### Inferential

 - Does Rain have an effect on the average daily water temperature?
 - What effect does rain have on the average daily temperature near the water?
 - What effect does rain have on the average daily temperature far from the water?
 - When it rains, is there a statistically significant difference between the amount of rain that falls in downtown Chicago compared to the Ohare airport?
 - How much correlation exists between the average daily temperature of Lake Michigan and the temperature difference between the downtown Chicago area and the Ohare airport?
  - Is there any statistically significant difference between the daily temperature near the water as apposed to far from the water?
 
### Predictive

 - Can we build a model that predicts with at least 80% accuracy the difference in total precipitation between Ohare airport and the the Botanical gardens?
