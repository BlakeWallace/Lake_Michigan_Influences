    "The goal of this project is to explore the influences of the presense of Lake Michigan on the weather in the Chicagoland area. See the Wikipedia article on [The Chicago Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area).  There are two things....There are three data sources used during this exploration.  Two of them are primary to the core of the analyses and model construction.  Our metrics used during our model construction were the mean squared error and the coefficient of determination.  The construction of a model in the context of \n",
